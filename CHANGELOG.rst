2.0 (Unreleased)
==================

A bunch of long-overdue modernizations of the codebase!

* Python 2 is no longer supported. Python 3.12 support was added along with fixed CI for 3.7 and 3.8, courtesy of @jayvdb
   * As a result of all this, setup.py's lint subcommand was removed. Please run the commands directly instead.
* You can now specify blocks of code that exclude linting with NOLINTBEGIN and NOLINTEND, courtesy of @n3world (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/213)
* The `--filter` option can now be only applied to a specific file or even a specific line through utilizing colons, e.g. `-filter=-whitespace:foo.h,+whitespace/braces:foo.h:418`. Courtesy of @PhilLab (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/171)
* NOLINT and NOLINTNEXTLINE comments now support a comma-separated list of categories, courtesy of @n3world (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/220)
* NOLINT and NOLINTNEXTLINE will now ignore categories known to be from clang-tidy thanks to @xatier (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/231)
* Fixed behavior with nested source repositories by @groegeorg (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/78)
* build/include-what-you-use no longer supports transitive headers from the header for the current module for parity with the style guide by @aaronliu0130
* build/include-what-you-use now supports a plethora of new functions, courtesy of @geoffviola (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/94)
* build/include-what-you-use will no longer err on similarly-named classes from other namespaces thanks to @geoffviola (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/273)
* Indented functions inside namespaces will now be correctly erred on, courtesy of @Yujinmon (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/235)
* The check for C-style casts now looks for the standard fixed-width integer typenames instead of non-standard ones (e.g. int32_t instead of int32) thanks to @nate-thirdwave (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/282)
* `[[(un)likely]]` no longer clouds readability/braces's super spyâˆ’scanning of braces, courtesy of @aaronliu0130 (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/265)
* C++20 headers will no longer be flagged as C headers thanks to @miker2 (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/216)
   * Same goes for C++23 and C23 headers, thanks to @aaronliu0130 (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/239)
   * "complex.h" will be treated as the C99 header instead of the legacy C++ header by @tkruse (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/219)
   * Many features not blocked in Google's style guide will no longer be erred own thanks to @aaronliu0130
      * As part of this, the build/c++14 and build/c++tr1 categories were removed.
      * The filesystem header will now also be blocked, and the build/c++17 category has been added.
* We will no longer bother you if you mark a no-arg constructor as explicit thanks to @markww (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/227)
   * In the same PR, @aaronliu0130 also decreased the verbosity of nagging to mark single-arg constructors as explicit to 4, as the styleguide includes a major exception to this rule that would be very hard to detect.
* You can now specify the name of the CPPLINT.cfg file through `--config` as long as it is in the same directory, thanks to @gedankenexperimenter (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/198)
* The new __VA_OPT__(,) will now be recognized by the Whitespace linter as a function thanks to @elrinor (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/237)
* The check for including a source file's header file will now scan all files with the same base name. Thanks to @crogre for figuring out what code needed to be changed and @aaronliu0130 for fixing it (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/104)
* `build/class` and `build/namespaces` no longer check for whether a namespace or class has a closing brace from @geoffviola (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/272). This should be done in a more efficient manner by a compiler or language server instead. As part of this, the `build/class` category was removed.
* Fixed false positive when an if/else statement has braces everywhere but one of the closing braces before the final block is on a separate line by @aaronliu0130 (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/265)
* Usages of the deprecated sre_compile were refectored by @jspricke (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/214)
* Usages of deprecated unittest aliases were refactored by @tirkarthi (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/182), @aaronliu0130 and @jayvdb
* Typos in this changelog, comments and functions were fixed by @jayvdb (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/245), @aaronliu0130 and @tkruse
* %-strings were modernized into f-strings by @aaronliu0130

* Fix #202 .hh files should not be considered system headers
* Fix #207 Python2 incompatibility for loading CPPLINT.cfg file
* Fix #184 NOLINT(clang-analyzer) comments should not cause warnings

1.6.0 (2022-02-19)
==================

* Fix #188: "Include the directory when naming header files" also for header files with other names like "*.hpp"

1.5.5 (2021-05-20)
==================

* Fix #172: Added 'size_t' to typecasts detected by CheckCStyleCast
* Fixed wrong CLI help text: Each filter needs + or -
* Fix #164: add elif as an exception for CheckSpacingForFunctionCall()

1.5.4 (2020-08-18)
==================

* Fix google#166, Allow space before C++11 attributes

1.5.3 (2020-07-20)
==================

* Fix #156: sed/gsed output parameter rejected
* Fix #156: sed/gsed output without other stdout information
* improvements to regression tests

1.5.2 (2020-06-24)
==================

* Fix #83, output formats "sed" and "gsed" to auto-fix some issues
* Fix #92, new category "build/namespaces_headers" for unnamed namespaces in header file
* Sort list of files before processing
* Fix #144 False positive for indent when using QT macros "signals" and "slots"
* Fix #76 Parsing of class decorators that also use digits
* Fix #139 Add message "Relative paths like . and .. are not allowed"

1.5.1 (2020-06-05)
==================

* Revert #43 behavior change for include order from 1.5.0, and hide it behind command-line-flag `--includeorder=standardcfirst`.
  It turns out there is no easy objective way to tell c system headers from certain c++ library headers, and Google cpplint intentionally classifies some C++ header includes as C system header for simplicity.
* Libraries considered as C system headers using --includeorder=standardcfirst now also includes linux-specific headers (glibc-devel, glibc-kernheaders, linux-libc-dev).


1.5.0 (2020-05-31)
==================

* Fix #43 false positives in header include order by checking includes against a list of c headers.
  Since this interprets certain include lines different than before, output about header include order changes.

==================

==================

* Avoid false positive for [build/include_what_you_use] in case of `map` is user defined function
* Escape backslashes in pydoc strings to get rid of DeprecationWarning.
* Fix false positive "should include its header" for 3rd party headers
* Add support for c++17 tuple destructuring
* fix #123: Inconsistent behavior of --headers and --extensions
* Fix #114: --exclude not working recursively
* fix #112, identifying of copy constructors should allow combinations of volatile and const
